# CLI

OpenCode CLI options and commands.

The OpenCode CLI by default starts the [TUI](/docs/tui) when run without any arguments.

```bash
opencode
```

But it also accepts commands as documented on this page. This allows you to interact with OpenCode programmatically.

```bash
opencode run "Explain how closures work in JavaScript"
```

---

## [Commands](#commands)

The OpenCode CLI also has the following commands.

---

### [agent](#agent)

Manage agents for OpenCode.

```bash
opencode agent [command]
```

---

#### [create](#create)

Create a new agent with custom configuration.

```bash
opencode agent create
```

This command will guide you through creating a new agent with a custom system prompt and tool configuration.

---

### [auth](#auth)

Command to manage credentials and login for providers.

```bash
opencode auth [command]
```

---

#### [login](#login)

OpenCode is powered by the provider list at [Models.dev](https://models.dev), so you can use `opencode auth login` to configure API keys for any provider youâ€™d like to use. This is stored in `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`.

```bash
opencode auth login
```

When OpenCode starts up it loads the providers from the credentials file. And if there are any keys defined in your environments or a `.env` file in your project.

---

#### [list](#list)

Lists all the authenticated providers as stored in the credentials file.

```bash
opencode auth list
```

Or the short version.

```bash
opencode auth ls
```

---

#### [logout](#logout)

Logs you out of a provider by clearing it from the credentials file.

```bash
opencode auth logout
```

---

### [github](#github)

Manage the GitHub agent for repository automation.

```bash
opencode github [command]
```

---

#### [install](#install)

Install the GitHub agent in your repository.

```bash
opencode github install
```

This sets up the necessary GitHub Actions workflow and guides you through the configuration process. [Learn more](/docs/github).

---

#### [run](#run)

```bash
opencode github run

### [models](#models)

List all available models from configured providers.

This command displays all models available across your configured providers in the format `provider/model`.

This is useful for figuring out the exact model name to use in [your config](/docs/config/).

---

### [run](#run-1)

Run opencode in non-interactive mode by passing a prompt directly.

```bash
opencode run [message..]
